        <h3>About the project:</h3>
        <p>
            This is a simple way to send encrypted messages over the premise of a boring email.<br> This was created
            with help from a variety of different resources: Chapter 6 of <i>Impractical Python Projects</i> by Lee Vaughan,
            study of the python-docx module, and study of the Vigenère cipher. More on the Vigenère cipher
            can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenere_cipher">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>How to use it</h3>

        <h5>Preparation</h5>
        <p>
            To prepare for running of the program, you must do the following:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create a .docx file containing the secret message you want to send.
                    <br><img src="{% static "projects/real_message.png" %}" alt="" width="50%"><br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a .docx file with a fake, boring message to hide your secret message in.</li>
                    <img src="{% static "projects/fake_message.png" %}" alt="" width="50%"><br><br>
                </li>
                <li>Create a .docx template file that contains no text but has all style, font, margins, etc. set.
                    <br><img src="{% static "projects/template.png" %}" alt="" width="50%"><br><br>
                </li>
            </ul>
            Additionally, if you'd like, you could customize the "HEADING_NAME", "HEADING_SUBTITLE", and "HEADING_DATE"
            variables in "encode.py" to fit your needs.
        </p>
        <h5>Encryption</h5>
        <p>
            To actually encrypt the code, just run "encode.py" and put in the names of the documents you created.
            Additionally, you'll need to come up with a unique cipher key to guide the encryption. A new file will be
            created with your hidden and encrypted message in it!
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, the resulting message looks totally innocent, even when highlighting it with a cursor!
            <br><br><img src="{% static "projects/result.png" %}" alt="" width="50%"><br>
        </p>
        <h5>Decryption</h5>
        <p>
            To see the text in the resulting file, you need to select all the text in the document and
            highlight it in black. Then, the secret message, encrypted via the Vigenère cipher, will be visible.
            <br><br><img src="{% static "projects/result_vig.png" %}" alt="" width="50%"><br><br>
            To decrypt text encrypted by this program, you just have to run "decode.py" and copy-paste in the text
            you want to decrypt.
        </p>
