            <p>
                My name is Samuel Hohenshell and I've got big dreams as a software engineer. I am currently a senior at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities College of Science and Engineering. I am studying for a B.S. in Computer Science and am on track to graduate Spring 2021. Welcome to my website!

            <h4>What is the purpose of this site?</h4>
            <p>
                This website started as a way to practice web development/Django and evolved into a medium to explain/show off my personal projects, write articles about things that interest me, practice JavaScript by making web apps, expand my HTML/CSS/JS knowledge, and more.
