<h1>Samuel Hohenshell - Portfolio Website Landing Page</h1>

<h4>Who am I?</h4>
<p>
    My name is Samuel Hohenshell and I am currently a senior at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities College
    of Science and Engineering. I am studying for a B.S. in Computer Science and am on track to graduate Spring 2021.
</p>

<h4>What is the purpose of this site?</h4>
<p>
    I made this website as a very basic way to practice web development/Django as well as a way to keep
    links to and explanations of various projects I have worked on all in one place.
</p>

<h4>What is on this website?</h4>
<p>
    This website has essentially two parts (for now). A "projects" section where you can find information about
    various coding projects I have worked on, and a "blog" section. The posts on the blog are just filler and for
    fun; the reason I made the blog was to practice adding another feature to my website.
