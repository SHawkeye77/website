Title:
Favorite Unix Commands

Category:
Fun

Body:
Unix is powerful. One like in the terminal can disrupt an entire system. Here are a few of my favorite beautiful, chaotic, etc. commands (in no particular order):

$ rm -rf /
Deletes entire computer

$ :(){:|:&};:
Creates a "Fork Bomb" - which is a process that continuously replicates itself to no end; effectively depleting all of a system's OS resources and rendering it useless

$ chmod -R 777 /
Give everyone and everything read/write/execute permission for everything on the machine

$ mv ~ /dev/null
Put your entire home directory in the "null" folder, essentially deleting it all.
