Title:
Alien Invasion

Description:
This is essentially the classic "Alien Invasion" arcade game coded with pygame.

When I first self-taught myself python, which was my first introduction to coding/programming, I followed a textbook. One of the projects at the end was this. It's not perfectly organized, but since I had been coding for literally less than 3 months at the time I felt it was pretty good (and fun!) all things considered.
