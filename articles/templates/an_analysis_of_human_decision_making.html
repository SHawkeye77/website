            An Analysis of Human Decision Making
        </h1>
        <p>
            Everything in life can be boiled down to a single equation. In a sense,
            humans are nothing more than more complex (or less complex?) computers. Originally, the word
            "computer" was actually used to describe humans - "human computers" carried out calculations
            and computations. Alan Turing said in 1950 - "The human computer is supposed to be following
            fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate from them in any detail."
        </p>

        <p>
            What if we could come up with a way to make all of our decisions like "human computers". I will argue that 
            it is in
            everyone's best interest to make every decision in their life based on the effect it
            will have on their happiness. That is the <i>"fixed rule"</i> of life. Everyone lives and makes decisions for
            one single reason: to increase their own personal happiness such that the pros outweigh the cons. You decide
            to eat a sandwich when you are hungry? You're doing this because removing the discomfort 
            of hunger will cause a net increase on your happiness. 
            You decide to follow Christianity? You believe that, by your own assessment of probability, it is
            possible God exists and spending eternity in Heaven will cause eternal happiness rather than eternal suffering
            in Hell, which outweighs all negative repercussions of being a Christian. You decide to donate money
            to a disaster relief charity? You believe the personal satisfaction of donation outweighs the
            satisfaction that that money could give you otherwise. There is no good or evil (in the definitive sense of
            the world), there is only a bunch of computers walking around, attempting to maximize an internal variable representing
            happiness.

            Every decision you and I make is meant to maximize our net happiness, something I will, from here on out, refer
            to with the variable <i>NH</i>. This is true for every single decision. Big or small. Any given second of your
            day, you are making a variety of decisions, and whether you know it or not, every single one is made (in your
            assessment) to maximize <i>NH</i>. Please allow me give some examples:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You are sitting at your desk at work and your forearm itches. Should you itch it or not?<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A few pros of itching:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Relief of discomfort.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>A few cons of itching:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Itching will take a small amount of physical exertion.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It will lead to a short period of productivity loss. There is a very small chance it leads to
                                    distraction causing even more productivity loss.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Sometimes itching causes an itch to increase in the future.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You are asked by your sister to babysit her daughter. Should you babysit or not?<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A few pros of babysitting:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Taking care of the child means she would likely recognise your kindness and be more
                                willing to do something for you in the future.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Denial may come off as a slight which could mean
                                negative feelings that could impact your relationship with her in the future.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Babysitting would cause some contentment based on the fact that you helped someone close
                                to you with a problem they had.
                            </li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>A few cons of babysitting:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Relaxing would feel better at the moment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Could set a precedent that you are willing (and maybe even eager?) to help out with things
                                    like this in the future.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            A few notes on the previous examples:
            Weighing pros and cons can get really, really complicated really, really fast. While it's pretty
            easy to come up with almost all notable repercussions of a small decision like whether or not you should itch
            your forearm, when
            it gets any more complicated it seems almost impossible to go through even a fraction of the possible repercussions.
            How do we get around this in decision making? 
            I think the best way to go about this is to narrow it down to the most important
            repercussions, where a "repercussion" is an outcome, resulting from the decion, that will alter your <i>NH</i>.
            Say there are "n" repercussions to a decision. Most likely "n" is huge - it could be millions, but one
            could argue the vast majority of repercussions don't even matter; you only need to come up with and analyze the most
            impactful repercussions such that successful analysis of those few would lead to a decision that would, beyond a 
            reasonable doubt, be unable to be flipped from negative to positive or positive to negative based on the net
            change resulting from all other repercussions. 

            <br><br>
            Additionally, why do we never consciously analyze decisions like the first example? Most decisions we make 
            have a set of possible outcomes that present such a small impact on our overall <i>NH</i> that 
            it is more damaging to our <i>NH</i> to spend time thinking about which path to take
            than it is to just make a quick decision. This is the case with subconscious decisions. We don't think about
            if we want to scratch an itch on our arm, our internal computer decides, before we even need to waste time
            thinking about it, that it is more worth it to just carry out one of the options of safe decisions.


            <br><br>
            Equation analysis:

            In my notation, <i>NH</i> is a spectrum. The negative end of the spectrum goes from slight discomfort
            to unignorable, unfathomable pain, while the positive end goes from mild satisfaction to absolute euphoria, while zero on the scale signifies complete indifference, a total lack of suffering as well as lack of joy.
            <br>
            I think every decision can be made based on the evaluation of the following equation:<br><br>
            <center><i>NH = I<sub>L</sub> + p &middot; E<sub>R</sub></i></center>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>NH</i>: "Net Happiness" - the variable discussed in detail earlier. If the calculated NH value is
                    negative, the decision should not be made OR should be weighed with the indecision.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>I<sub>L</sub></i>: Lump sum of net happiness loss as a result of the decision. This can only be a
                    negative number. It represents a numerical value for the "cons" of the decision. This number must be
                    scaled by time. E.g. If I lose 5 happiness points per day, and the payout is not for 30 days,
                    then <i>I<sub>L</sub></i> = -150 total for this decision. Note that for any even somewhat complicated decision,
                    this will actually be the sum of all detrimental repercussions of the decision, not just a single number.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>p</i>: Probability of receiving the full expected payout down the road (must be 0-1). This is just 1 if
                    the payout is immediate and certain, but if the decision makes use of delayed gratification this is
                    important to take into account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>E<sub>R</sub></i>: The expected, eventual lump sum happiness payout of the original decision. Be sure to
                    scale this by time. E.g. If the initial decisionâ€™s full payout will be an increase in happiness
                    of 5 points/day for 7 days, then <i>E<sub>R</sub></i> = 35. Note that for any even somewhat complicated decision, this will actually be the sum of all net positive repercussions of the decision, not just a single
                    number.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
        <br>
        This all might seem dumb or obvious; <i>I am saying we make decisions to be happy? Duh!</i> At the very least, though,
        I think this is actually a great way to analyze difficult decisions. On a grand scale, however, imagine if we could
        create a way to accurately calculate and make decisions based on this. A computer could make every
        single decision for you in your life. This would allow you to go through life in an optimal fashion.

        <br><br>
        Notes on using this equation:
        <ul>
            <li>
                "Machine learning" (learning from experience) should be utilized. Learning from the outcome of one
                decision will impact decisions in the future. Due to this, new decisions should likely be scaled
                higher, as they provide more data for your machine learning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Likely more important than any physical decisions for <i>NH</i> are intangible decisions, such as what
                to spend time thinking about.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        Questions/Problems:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Are the <i>NH</i> values of others important whatsoever beyond their influence on my own <i>NH</i> 
                (in the fact that others' happiness increases my own happiness)? 
                If so, doesn't that contradict the assertion that one should not be relying on others for my own happiness? If there is a middle ground, how do I define that spectrum in relation to my current idea?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is it feasible to think this equation could ever be implemented beyond just a
                thought exercise or a method to guide decision making?
            </li>
            <li>
                Could I come up with real units for <i>NH</i>? Four major chemicals in our brain affect happiness:
                dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins. If there was some way to measure the actual chemical effect
                of decisions we could make this more tangible useful.
